Note-WinForm

A desktop based note taking application made as a Window Form and programmed in C#. Creates and stores notes as Extensible Markup Language Files (xml) on users' local machines. Can create new notes, save notes, delete notes, and read/edit notes (essentially CRUD). The saved notes are also displayed in a data table. Currently working on stlying options: bold, italics, underline, font size/color/type. Will also update the UI for a more modern and aesthetic feel. This project is meant to help learn C#, get used to managing a project with git, gain exposure to .NET's capabilities, and learn project best practices.
